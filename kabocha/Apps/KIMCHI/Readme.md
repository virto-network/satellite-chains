### KIMCHI: An incentivised KSM:DOT prediction market

KIMCHI isn't just a bet.

**It’s a wild call that KSM will flip DOT.**

A straightforward, high-stakes wager on whether Kusama (KSM) can close the gap on Polkadot (DOT), settled in dUSD through smart contracts.

If you’re tired of safe plays and ready to see KSM punch above its weight, welcome to KIMCHI.

### 1. **The KIMCHI Play**

The game here is simple: you’re betting that **KSM will close the gap with DOT**. 

If you believe Kusama’s fast-and-loose attitude has what it takes to narrow in on Polkadot’s value, then KIMCHI is for you. 

There’s no final "win"—just a dynamic, ongoing battle between Polkadot and Kusama, with competition keeping the entire ecosystem on its toes.

### 2. **Why KIMCHI Is Different**

KIMCHI is born from Kusama's experimental ethos: freedom, speed, and a community-driven approach that embraces risk.

Similar to a prediction market, users place bets on whether KSM will outperform DOT, with payouts settled in dUSD as the price ratio shifts in KSM’s favour.

Conversely, if DOT outperforms, users experience a loss, incentivising accurate predictions.

Unlike DOT’s brand image, KIMCHI leans into the chaos and creativity that emerges from recognising that there are no rules.

### 3. **KIMCHI Mechanism**

**KIMCHI tracks the relative performance of KSM against DOT.**

Instead of reflecting KSM or DOT’s individual prices, KIMCHI operates as a prediction market, allowing users to make bets on the ratio of DOT/KSM, with automated settlement in dUSD.

This approach allows users to profit if KSM gains on DOT, regardless of whether DOT and KSM are rising or falling in the overall market.

##### How it Works

- **Price Calculation**: The value of bets is based on the DOT/KSM ratio:
  
  - **When KSM gains against DOT** (the ratio decreases), users win.
  - **When DOT gains against KSM** (the ratio increases), users lose.
 
- **Bet Settlement**: Bets are settled automatically in dUSD based on the outcome at the end of the betting period.

### 4. **Example Scenarios**

1. **Short-Term Bet**: A user bets that KSM will outperform DOT over one week. If KSM rises in value relative to DOT, they receive their payout in dUSD.
   
2. **Long-Term Bet**: Another user places a three-month bet that KSM will flip DOT. If KSM surpasses DOT at the end of the period, they win, incentivising long-term engagement.

KIMCHI empowers users to engage in high-stakes predictions, embracing the unpredictable nature of the crypto market, all while providing an intuitive interface and clear settlement mechanics.
